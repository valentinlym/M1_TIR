	abstract = {More than 300 million people use the gamified mobile-assisted language learning ({MALL}) application (app) Duolingo. The challenging tasks, reward incentives, systematic levels, and the ranking of users according to their achievements are just some of the elements that demonstrate strong gamification elements within this popular language learning application. This application’s pervasive reach, flexible functionality, and freemium business model has brought significant attention to gamification in {MALL}. The present systematic review aims to summarize different methods, frameworks, settings, and research samples used to assess Duolingo’s design and impact on various learning outcomes. We carried out a complete database search for articles focused on the issues of design, application, and pedagogies in the use of Duolingo. Three hundred and sixty-seven records were initially found, and 35 of those were selected for final inclusion based on language choice, theoretical frameworks, design, sampling, data collection, and analyses (see Appendix 1 for full list). The results indicated that the majority of research from 2012-2020 was design-focused, quantitative in nature, and used non-probability sampling methods. The focus on app design marks an emphasis on the creation of tools rather than the process and outcomes of language learning from using these tools. Additional results revealed preferences for performance-based research questions, for English as language of choice in research, and for the {USA} as the most prominent context for Duolingo research studies. Furthermore, our review highlights research gaps specific to Duolingo, yet generalizable to other {MALL} applications. The results are useful to researchers seeking to assess, evaluate, and understand {MALL}, gamification, and Duolingo as well as to practitioners interested in utilizing {MALL} in formal and informal learning environments.},

	abstract = {Employing digital or non-digital game elements in the learning environment to boost students’
engagement and participation is very important to achieve specific and specified learning objectives.
In a world where technology is touching nearly every element of life, gamification or game-based
learning has supported learning skills, and provided opportunities for students to learn and practice
soft skills through teamwork within games. One of the main challenges in the English language
classroom is the lack of active participation from all students due to fear of making mistakes, shyness,
and anxiety. They lack confidence and are afraid to speak the language which can impede the learning
objective. Most of the time only the same group of students will contribute to the activities carried out
in the classroom. This paper aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification in enhancing students'
learning interest, motivation, and engagement in learning English as a Second Language ({ESL}). An
intervention was carried out among Form 4 students from 2 classes (in total of 40 students).
Gamification applications such as Class Dojo and Genially were used in the English language lesson.
The primary purpose of integrating game-based learning is to give students a different learning
experience. It helps to make students motivated during the lesson, enhancing friendly competition
among peers and promoting a fun way of learning. After the teaching sessions, students were given a
questionnaire to find out their perception of how gamification influences their learning behavior
during the {ESL} lesson. The feedback indicated that gamification has a positive effect on the students,
and it can significantly increase their learning interest, motivation, and engagement levels, leading to
improved learning outcomes in the English language. In addition, they felt that this new technique of
learning was interesting, innovative, and enjoyable, hence enhancing their learning interest in the
subject. This shows that gamification can be an effective way to stimulate {ESL} learners in increasing
students’ learning interest, motivation, and engagement in the classroom},

	abstract = {Gamification, a design technique that uses the motivational elements of
games in other contexts, is increasingly looked at as a possible solution to the
dropping levels of motivation observed in learners. However, previous research
has presented mixed results as to the demonstration of whether gamification in education works or not. To better evaluate the potential of gamification, we argue
that it is important to first focus on how gamification works. This chapter contributes to this discussion by asking three research questions, starting by specifying
“What is gamification?” (Q1), to then revealing “How does gamification work?”
(Q2). Looking at gamification from the perspective of Self-Determination Theory,
we show that various types of motivation guide people’s behaviour differently,
and point to the importance of basic psychological need satisfaction. Furthermore,
the answers to our first two research questions will explain why adding game elements as external, meaningless regulations is likely to cause detrimental effects on
learners’ intrinsic motivation. Finally, by cumulating these theory-informed insights, we address our last research question “How can gamification design be improved?” (Q3), and define 9 Gamification Heuristics that account for (the interplay between) design, context and user characteristics. As such, this chapter forms
a guide for researchers, educators, designers and software developers in fostering
a promising future generation of gamified systems that resonates our plea for theory-driven design},

	abstract = {We explore the importance of gamification features in a language-learning platform designed for intermediate-to-advanced learners. Our main thesis is: learning toward advanced levels requires a massive investment of time. If the learner engages in more practice sessions, and if the practice sessions are longer, we can expect the results to be better. This principle appears to be tautologically self-evident. Yet, keeping the learner engaged in general—and building gamification features in particular—requires substantial efforts on the part of developers. Our goal is to keep the learner engaged in long practice sessions over many months—rather than for the short-term. In academic research on language learning, resources are typically scarce, and gamification usually is not considered an essential priority for allocating resources. We argue in favor of giving serious consideration to gamification in the language-learning setting—as a means of enabling in-depth research. In this paper, weintroduce several gamification incentives in the Revita language-learning platform. We discuss the problems in obtaining quantitative measures of the effectiveness of gamification features},

	issn = {2736-5522},
	abstract = {Gamification  or  game-based  learning  is  the  current  trend  in  education which is steadily increasing its popularity across several fields involving academic learning. Gamification is the incorporation of gaming elements into  a  learning  environment  in  order  to  increase  engagement  and participation.  It  enhances  learner’s  participation,  motivate  actions, efficiently  improve  their  academic  performance  as  well  as  effectively facilitate language learning. Undoubtedly, participation is essential for an effective  game-based  language  learning  system.  Language  learning through  games  can  take  many  forms,  such  as  role-playing  games  to practicecommunication  or  board  games  to  reinforce  grammar. Furthermore, gamified learning software, for example, may boost student engagement,  retention  and  academic  performance.  On  the  one  hand, proponents of gamification claim that it improves learning. Gamification reinforces important educational skills like problem-solving, collaboration, and  communication.  Moreover,  it  is  argued  that  the  requirement  for interaction in a gamified approach to education encourages students to participate  actively  in  their  education,  resulting  in  increased  student engagement in online forums, projects, and other learning activities. E-learning platforms seemto potentially enhance students’ motivation, and great efforts are needed to develop and implement an experience to make it completely motivating to participants. Gamification research is gaining traction and promises to aid in the resolution of many issues. Hence, this article  could  potentially  offer  ideas  to  educators  to  design  technology-mediated learning environments. Based on a review of various prior works, this article explored the many reasons gamification should be incorporated into school curriculums for language learning, as well as the benefits for learners.  It  also  critically  focused  on  the  application  of  gamification components to improve learning via online learning systems},

We exploit the key idea that all discrete probability distributions can be reduced to unbiased coin-flipping schemes. The compiler pipeline first translates cpGCL programs into choice-fix trees, an intermediate representation suitable for reduction of biased probabilistic choices. Choice-fix trees are then translated to coinductive interaction trees for execution within the random bit model. The correctness of the composed translations establishes the sampling equidistribution theorem: compiled samplers are correct wrt. the conditional weakest pre-expectation semantics of cpGCL source programs. Zar is implemented and fully verified in the Coq proof assistant. We extract verified samplers to OCaml and Python and empirically validate them on a number of illustrative examples.},
